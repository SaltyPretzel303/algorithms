# algorithms
Collection of algorithms mainly used for comparing execution times with different implementation details. 

To test algorithms first run: `pip install -e . `  
This will initialize all the things.  

Most of the alghoritms will accept input from stdin (cli pipe).  
If stdin is empty frist cli argument should be input file path.
